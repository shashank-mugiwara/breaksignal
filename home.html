<p>Welcome to Breaksignal, I am Shashank J - author of this blog. Here you can find experiments and content related to tech and software. This blog is hosted on my old computer and is being reverse proxied through my RaspberryPi. So if this blog disappears at random times then you can safely assume that either there is a power cut at my place or either my old computer or my RaspberryPi has gone KA BOOM.</p>
<p>Few things that you can find here are related more to servers, AI/ML and Databases. You can also find some content not related to tech but the number is very small. Featured posts are given below for each domain, rest you will be able to find under the <code>Browse</code> icon to the left.</p>
<p>Happily Breaksignal !</p>
