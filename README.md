If you are able to view this page, then my RaspberryPi is running fine, serving some crazy content over the internet. I have a pretty good internet connection and a static IP except power backup. So if this page disappears at random times you can safely assume that there is a power cut at my place or some robber might have robbed my Pi and is now auctioned at some _Chor Baazar_
