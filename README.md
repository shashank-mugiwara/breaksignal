## About Me, Cat and RaspberryPi - [breaksignal.com](https://breaksignal.com)

If you are able to view this page, then my RaspberryPi is running fine, serving some crazy content over the internet. I have a pretty good internet connection and a static IP except power backup. So if this page disappears at random times you can safely assume that there is a power cut at my place or some robber might have robbed my Pi and is now auctioned at some _Chor Baazar_

The below avatars include Me (Shashank J), My Cat (LeoRio, which I don't own) and My RaspberryPi.

## API Gateway and Other Service Endpoints:
If I am running any services locally at my end, I would've exposed those services for your use. I use `traefik` API gateway to route your requests to different services that I run locally. You can see the dashboard [here](http://122.166.84.137:4000/) and to know more about the services that I have exposed go [here](http://122.166.84.137:4000/).
