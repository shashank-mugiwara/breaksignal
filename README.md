## Breaksignal Technology Blog

If you are able to view this page, then my RaspberryPi is running fine, serving some crazy content over the internet. I am running this site and services on my Pi. I have a pretty good internet connection and a static IP except power backup. So if this site disappears at random times you can safely assume that there is a power cut at my place or some robber might have robbed my Pi and is now auctioned at some _Chor Baazar_.

The below avatars include Me (_Shashank J_), My Cat (_LeoRio_, which I don't own) and My RaspberryPi. You can find more about me under **_Personal_** section to your left.

## Gateway
If I am running any services locally from my room at my end, I would've exposed few services that I developed for your use. Its being routed through API gateway installed and configured on my Pi. To know more about the services and middleware that are configured you can visit [https://gateway.breaksignal.com](https://gateway.breaksignal.com) and to know more about the services that I have exposed go [here](https://gateway.breaksignal.com).
